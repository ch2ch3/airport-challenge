Airport Challenge
=================

The Week 3 Friday Challenge at Makers Academy was to create a set of classes and/or modules to simulate air traffic control at an airport. The code includes a Plane class, and Airport class, and a Weather module. Planes can land at the airport as long as the airport has not reached full capacity. When the weather is stormy, all traffic is halted, and planes are not allowed to land or take off.
